## About Me

I am a Senior studying computer science. Currently my academic interests are in intellegent systems and computer graphics. In my spare time I work on small game development projects, primarily on Unity.
My initial interest in Computer Science comes from wanting to know how video games are made, and I have since progressed to focusing on a combination of software
used in games and development and applications of intellgent systems.
