## Awesome!!

(A current limitation of the bundler is that local image paths don't get interpolated when embedded in markdown.)


Also, links are automatically recognized as links (no more redundant specifying `a` tags!)

If you want to [give a link a custom title](https://www.google.com/), you can *still* do that. 

```
// This is a code block.
